# Using lable and labelOptions

> Note: The following usages use the demo database. You have to custumize your own setting table before practical use!

[`yii\widgets\ActiveField`](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/yii-widgets-activefield.html#label()-detail) uses `setting key` as `label`.

You can setup `hintoptions` and `labeloptions` in DB, refer to [`yii\widgets\ActiveField#label()`](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/yii-widgets-activefield.html#label()-detail)

> Note: Hint is html-encoded, so support for HTML code.
