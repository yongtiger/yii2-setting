# Using hint and hintOptions

> Note: The following usages use the demo database. You have to custumize your own setting table before practical use!

You can setup `hintoptions` in DB, refer to [`yii\widgets\ActiveField#hint()`](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/yii-widgets-activefield.html#hint()-detail)

> Note: Label is not html-encoded, so support for HTML code.
